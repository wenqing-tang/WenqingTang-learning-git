A dairy of October 4th
Today is a most sunny day in recent days. I can see many mosquitoes outside the windows around the front garden. I'm not sure where they are from and I'm afraid that they would enter my bedroom, so I close the window tightly and only open the window in the living room to prevent insects flying in my flat. The sky is so beautiful that I really want to get some fresh air around the apartment, But I won't do that unless I finish my study task on time.
